# MLHFellowshipCodeSample for Joan Nandaula
This is my submission for the MLH fellowship code sample.

This code sample is from a class group project where the goal was to develop a collaborative whiteboarding tool. These are the features that I worked on:
* The toolbar with the icons on the whiteboard canvas
* I added functionality to the shape tool so a user can insert shapes
* I worked on the zooming in and out functionality
* I worked on the file management capability, (user can save a whiteboard and open it later to continue editing)
* A few bugs I fixed include the ability for other users on the shared whiteboard to see the shapes being drawn by the primary creator of the whiteboard
* Another bug was making sure there was no unexpected activity on the whiteboard when pen color was changed.
* This project was built with Lit, Vite and Typescript
* To run this project, after cloning the repo, run npm install to get the dependencies then npm run dev and open the url
